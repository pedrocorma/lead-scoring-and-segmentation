## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The client is an online education company which sells an online course to industry professionals.

The company markets their course on different websites and search engines. Once professionals who are interested in the course land on the website, they might browse the course or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals.

Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not, with the inefficiency of this process impacting companyâ€™s benefits.

2. Creating advanced analytical assets such as a predictive lead scoring and customer segmentation algorithms that helps sales team to identify both potential customers who are most likely to convert into paying customers and leads who are not economically profitable to manage.
